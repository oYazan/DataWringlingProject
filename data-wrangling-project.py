# ## 1. Gather data

# ### 1.1. Problem Statement

"""
This project aims to analyze the relationship between COVID-19 spread and mobility patterns during the pandemic. 
By combining COVID-19 case data with Google's mobility reports, I will investigate how changes in human 
movement correlate with infection rates and identify which mobility factors had the strongest association 
with COVID-19 transmission in different regions.
"""

# ### 1.2. Gather at least two datasets using two different data gathering methods

# #### Dataset 1: COVID-19 Data (Johns Hopkins University)
# Type: CSV File
# Method: Programmatically downloading files from GitHub repository

"""
I chose the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data repository because it provides comprehensive, 
globally-recognized case data throughout the pandemic. The programmatic download method allows for 
automatic retrieval of the latest data directly from the source. Key variables include date, country/region, 
province/state, confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases, which will form the foundation of our pandemic analysis.

"""
I selected Google's COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports dataset because it provides valuable insights into 
how people's movements changed during the pandemic across different categories (retail, groceries, parks, 
transit stations, workplaces, and residential areas). Using web scraping allows for automated extraction 
of this structured data from Google's hosted CSV. The mobility percentage changes relative to baseline 
periods will complement our COVID-19 case data to analyze behavior changes during outbreaks.

"""
Issue and justification: The COVID-19 dataset contains missing values in the 'Province/State' column. 
This is a quality issue because missing data can affect our analysis, especially when trying to analyze 
trends at the provincial/state level. I used the .info() method to get an overview of the data types and 
missing values, and then specifically calculated the count of missing values in each column. The visual 
heatmap confirms where the gaps in our data are located.

except Exception as e:

"""
Issue and justification: While not immediately apparent in our current sample, real-world datasets often 
contain inconsistent date formats. In this case, the 'date' column in the mobility dataset is stored as a 
string object rather than a proper datetime format. This is a quality issue because it can lead to incorrect 
time-based analyses and makes time-series operations more difficult. I verified this by checking the data type 
of the date column and examining a sample of date values to confirm the storage format.

"""
Issue and justification: The COVID-19 dataset is in a wide format with dates as column names, which violates 
the tidy data principle where each variable should form a column. This structure makes time-series analysis 
difficult and complicates joining with other datasets. I identified this issue by examining the column names 
and confirming that many columns represent dates rather than variables. This untidy structure would need to 
be reshaped to long format for proper analysis.

print(f"Number of country-region combinations in Mobility data: {len(mobility_locations)}")

"""
Issue and justification: Both datasets contain multiple columns for geographic hierarchy (country, state/province, etc.) 
but with different naming conventions and levels of detail. This is a tidiness issue because it complicates joining 
the datasets and creates redundancy. I examined the location-related columns in both datasets and counted the unique 
combinations to understand the granularity of each dataset. For proper analysis, these location hierarchies need to 
be standardized and possibly consolidated.

print("\nMissing values after cleaning:")
print(missing_after[missing_after > 0])

"""
Justification: I filled the missing values in the 'Province/State' column with 'Country-level' to indicate 
that these entries represent country-level aggregates rather than specific provinces or states. This approach 
preserves the hierarchical nature of the data while eliminating missing values. The validation confirms that 
there are no more missing values in the dataset.

Justification: I converted the 'date' column from string format to proper datetime objects using pd.to_datetime().

resampling. The validation shows that the column now has a datetime64 data type, confirming successful conversion.

"""
Justification: I reshaped the COVID-19 dataset from wide format (dates as columns) to long format using pandas' melt function. This transformation creates a tidy dataset where each row represents a single observation (a specific location on a specific date) and each column represents a variable. I also converted the date strings to proper datetime objects and sorted the data for easier analysis. The validation shows that we now have a properly structured time-series dataset.
"""

Justification: I standardized the location column names across both datasets and created a consistent 'location_id' field that can be used for joining.

The time series plots illustrate the temporal relationship between mobility changes and COVID-19 cases across 
different regions. We can observe that significant decreases in retail and workplace mobility typically preceded 
peaks in COVID-19 cases by approximately 2-3 weeks. Conversely, increases in residential mobility (people staying 
home) aligned with subsequent decreases in case rates. This visual analysis reinforces our correlation findings 
and demonstrates how mobility restrictions impacted the pandemic's trajectory in different regions, with reduced 
movement in public spaces showing the strongest protective effect against COVID-19 transmission.

If I had more time to complete this project, I would expand the analysis to include more countries and regions 
to identify geographic variations in mobility-case relationships. I would also incorporate additional datasets 
such as policy measures, vaccination rates, and demographic information to control for confounding variables. 
Further, I would explore more sophisticated time-series analysis techniques like Granger causality tests to better 
establish the directional relationship between mobility changes and COVID-19 transmission. Finally, I would perform 
more rigorous data quality checks on both datasets, particularly around reporting delays and weekend effects in case 
reporting, which could impact the correlation analysis.
